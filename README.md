**RTC(RocketThrustCalc)** is a lightweight application designed to calculate the thrust of rocket engines based on provided measurements such as fuel type, burn rate, rocket tip dimensions, and pressure. It is built for both aerospace engineers and those looking to experiment with rocket designs

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accurate thrust calculation based on rocket propulsion equations
- Simple, user-friendly graphic interface
- Unit conversion tools 
- Visualization of thrust/acceleration over time
